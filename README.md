**Turn Cloudflare R2 into your personal AI memory bank** - Store, sync, and access AI contexts from anywhere in the world with military-grade encryption and zero egress fees.

## What is CloudContext?

CloudContext is a secure, distributed AI context storage service built on Cloudflare's global infrastructure. It enables AI applications and users to maintain persistent, encrypted context across sessions and devices, solving the fundamental problem of AI memory limitations.

### The Problem We Solve

Modern AI assistants lose context between conversations, forcing users to repeatedly provide background information. CloudContext bridges this gap by creating a persistent, secure memory layer that:

- **Preserves Context**: Maintain conversation history and user preferences across sessions
- **Enables Continuity**: Pick up where you left off on any device, anywhere
- **Scales Globally**: Leverage Cloudflare's 330+ edge locations for low-latency access
- **Ensures Privacy**: Your data is encrypted end-to-end with AES-256-GCM

### Use Cases

- **AI Assistants**: Maintain conversation context and user preferences
- **Development Tools**: Store project context and coding patterns
- **Research Applications**: Preserve research notes and findings
- **Multi-device Workflows**: Sync AI contexts across desktop, mobile, and web
